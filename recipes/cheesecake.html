    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It’s no secret that I love a silky smooth cheesecake. I’ve made several of them over the last two years. My most popular one being a luscious Nutella cheesecake and followed by that is my favorite triple chocolate cheesecake.<br>

        But today we’re celebrating my supremely creamy cheesecake and I’ve topped it off with a homemade fresh strawberry topping.<br>
        
        You guys, this is one swoon-worthy dessert. I sent one to my husband’s new boss and got rave reviews.<br>
        
        There’s really nothing fancy with today’s recipe. It’s simple, light, and fresh. You’ll probably be able to enjoy more than one slice without feeling bogged down and heavy.<br>
        
        And with strawberries coming into season soon, I can think of no better way to highlight this bright red, juicy fruit.<br>
        
        If it’s too hot to make a baked cheesecake, give this no bake strawberry cheesecake a try! It’s just as delightful.</p>
